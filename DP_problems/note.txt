    - Memoization Recipe
        1. Make it work
            - visualize the problem as a tree
            - implement the tree using recursion
            - test it
        2. Make it efficient
            - add a memo object
            - add a base case to return memo values
            - store return values into the memo
    - Tabulation Recipe
        - visualize the problem as a table
        - size the table based on the inputs
        - initialize the table with default values
        - seed the trivial answer into the table
        - iterate through the table
        - fill further positions based on the current position
